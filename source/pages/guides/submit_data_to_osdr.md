# Submit Data to OSDR

## Data Submission Guide

If you have any questions during the data submission process, please contact the OSDR Curation team at [arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov](mailto:arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov).

### [Summary of guidelines for Data Submission to OSDR](https://genelab.nasa.gov/guidelines-data-submission-osdr)

*Note: If you have a NASA-funded study, and you have not yet filled out a Research Data Submission Agreement (RDSA), please contact OSDR at [arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov](mailto:arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov). Your RDSA will be used to create your study. If you already have an RDSA, your experiment record will have a study associated. You can create more studies as needed.*  

#### Step 1: Review a Dataset  

First, review one of the existing datasets in OSDR to become familiar with the format such as [OSD-48](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-48) (animal), [OSD-38](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-38) (plant), or [OSD-554](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-554) (microbe)  

#### Step 2: Create an Account  

Follow the instructions in the {doc}`creating_a_nasa_guest_account` tutorial to create an account to submit data in the OSDR Submission Portal, the Biological Data Management Environment (BDME).  

#### Step 3: Review Submission Tutorial  

Before submitting your data, review the {ref}`biological-data-management-environment-bdme-tutorial` section below.

#### Step 4: Create a Study  

Following the {ref}`biological-data-management-environment-bdme-tutorial`, create a study or studies.

*Note: OSDR recommends organizing non-plant studies by organism and tissue type and plant studies only by organism. **If your submission contains data from more than one tissue type, please create a new study for each tissue.** Failure to do so could lead to delays in curation, as well as an incomplete list of DOIs to include in your manuscript.*  

#### Step 5: Enter Metadata and Upload Data Files  

OSDR organizes metadata into sample-level information and assay-level information. Data files are uploaded into the [workspace](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/workspace-sso-login.html) and can be associated with each study.  

*Note: For file names, please use common acronyms as defined on the {ref}`osdr_abbreviations` page, whenever possible. If your data has acronyms, scientific terms, or column names that need to be defined, please include a data dictionary with your study. An example data dictionary can be found in dataset [OSD-618](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-618) (Files > Novel Object Recognition > Data Dictionary Files).*   

### [Data Submission Portal](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission-sso-login.html)  

The Biological Data Management Environment (BDME) is a web-based system that accepts submission of data and respective metadata from space-relevant experiments including spaceflight and ground-based analog experiments.  

**Logging into BDME:** To get started, use your NASA guest account to [login to BDME](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission-sso-login.html). If you do not have an account, follow the instructions in the {doc}`creating_a_nasa_guest_account` tutorial. Please note the NASA Guest Accounts are not managed by the OSDR team. Any issues must be reported to the NASA Enterprise Service Desk (ESD). NASA ESD can be reached 24/7 at 1-877-677-2123.  

### [OSDR submission console](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/submission/console)  

After logging into BDME, you will see the OSDR submission console as pictured below.  

### Data Submission Console Features  

The data submission console allows users to review their RDSAs and experiments (a series of studies, usually grant-level related), and to create, track, and review OSDR studies (the scientific data).

### How to Create a New OSD Study  

**1. Click on the**  

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-create-new-study-button.png
:alt: Create New Study button
```

**button in the top right-hand corner of the page.**  

**2. Select "Create a Study".**  

- In this example the data is not from a NASA-funded grant, which is highlighted in blue, so the user can click "Next" to create their new OSDR accession number.  

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-welcome-to-guided-submission.png
:alt: Welcome page to the guided submission portal
:width: 800px
```

#### Select Factor  

**3. Choose a factor:** Select a factor from the drop-down list that best describes your study and then click "Let's get started." If you do not see a factor that describes your study in the drop-down menu, click the "Other" button to email the curation team for review.    

- In this example, the user has selected "Gravitropism".    

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-guided-submission-factors.png
:alt: Factor option stage in the guided submission portal
:width: 800px
```

4. There is nothing to do on the next screen, just click "Let's get started".  

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-guided-submission-start.png
:alt: Guided submission portal lets get started button
:width: 800px
```

#### Upload Raw Data   

**5. Raw data files are required but can be uploaded later**. If you plan to upload your raw data files at a later time, select "I will upload files later" then click "Next".  

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-guided-submission-upload-raw-data.png
:alt: OSDR guided submission raw data
:width: 800px
```

**6. Upon creating a new study, an OSD accession number and DOI are automatically assigned for your study.** These identifiers can be used when submitting manuscripts for peer review. When you see this screen, a new study has been successfully created and you can start curating your research using the OSDR metadata standards.  

```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-guided-submission-study-identifiers.png
:alt: New study with OSD ID and DOI
:width: 800px
```

**7. Upload study files from your workspace.** If you did not upload your raw data files in step 5 above, they can be uploaded at this step. Follow the instructions to select the Resource Category and Subcategory (if applicable) from the drop down-menu(s) that describe your files. Then select the files to be associated from your workspace and click the "Associate" button.  

*Note: If you do not have files in your workspace, they can be added directly at this step by dragging and dropping them in one of your workspace folders or you can follow the [instructions here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kCZX7NpMhk4vZbzb8s_pgUTOorvnXZVi4bwmAPALLXc) to login to your [workspace](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/workspace-sso-login.html) and upload files.*  


```{image} ../../_static/images/bdme/osdr-guided-submission-upload-files.png
:alt: Associating files to Resource Category and Subcategory
:width: 800px
```

When you have completed uploading all files for all assays associated with your study, click "Next" at the bottom of the page.  

*Note: If you are not ready to upload files at this time, you can skip this step for now by clicking "Next" at the bottom of this page.*  

#### Add study-level info

**8. Select a Study Design Descriptor.** Click the "+ Add" button in the Study Design Descriptor field then start typing a word or phrase that best describes your study. A drop-down menu will appear with controlled ontology terms for you to select from. If you do not see an appropriate descriptor come up, select "add more terms".
