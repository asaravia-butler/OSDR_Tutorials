# Use the OSDR Workspace

## The OSDR Workspace

The [OSDR workspace](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/workspace-sso-login.html) is used for uploading data files that can be shared with collaborators and selected in the data submission portal for association with OSD (study) accessions. Users can also download files from their workspace.

## Workspace Console

The workspace console allows users to view, upload, and download files to their workspace.

*Note: Each user is initially assigned 50GB. If you need more space, contact the OSDR Curation team at [arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov](mailto:arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov).*
